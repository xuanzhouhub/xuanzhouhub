    <p><b>Course I: Contemporary Data Management System.</b> 
     Data managements systems nowadays are not limited to RDBMS (SQL). A variety of systems are widely adopted in contemporary applications,
     including various NoSQL and data analytical systems. The landscape of data technologies are evolving fast. Traditional introductory courses
     on Database need to be reformed accordingly. This course is an attempt towards this direction.
     My lectures (in Chinese) can be found
