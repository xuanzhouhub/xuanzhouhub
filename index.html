       <h2>Xuan Zhou</h2>
       <p>Xuan Zhou is a Professor and a Vice Dean of the <a href="http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/">School of Data Science and Engineering</a> at 
        <a href="https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/">East China Normal University</a>. Prior to joining ECNU in 2017, 
       he was an associate professor at <a href="https://www.ruc.edu.cn/">Renmin University of China</a>, a scientist at CSIRO ICT Center 
        (now renamed to <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/about/people/business-units/data61">Data61</a>) of Australia, and a researcher at
       <a href="https://www.l3s.de/en">L3S Research Center</a> of Germany. He obtained his Ph.D. from <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">
        National University of Singapore</a> in 2005 and his B.Sc. from <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/">Fudan University</a> in 2001. Xuan Zhou's
       research interest lies in data management systems. He has extensive research and engineering experience on database, data processing and data 
       interaction systems. </p>

    <h2><u>Publications</u></h2>
    <p>I have little time to maintain my publication list properly. Please refer to <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/32/3943-1.html">my DBLP page</a>.</p>
    <p><b>My personal view on academic publication:</b>Academics publish too much, moare than we can handle. One probable reason is that we (intentionaly or 
     unintentionaly) measure academic performance using the number of publications. I believe that this idea will be revolutionized, sooner or later.
     In the future, research results might be more accessible on some open project platfoms, such as GitHub, where data and programs are readily available. 
     It will have profound impact on the way we conduct research.</p>
    <p><b>My recent views on data management technologies</b> have been summarized in two of my recent talks, one in Meituan Top Talk 
     (<a href="https://tech.meituan.com/2020/11/05/top-talk-database.html">link</a>), 
     the other in Gauss Squirrel Club (<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eV4y1J7Pf/?share_source=copy_web">link</a>). </p>

    <h2><u>Teaching</u></h2>
    <p>I love teaching.</p>
    <p><b>Course I: Contemporary Data Management System.</b> 
     Data managements systems nowadays are not limited to RDBMS (SQL). A variety of systems are widely adopted in contemporary applications,
     including various NoSQL and data analytical systems. The landscape of data technologies are rapidly evolving. Traditional introductory courses
     on Database need to be reformed accordingly. This course is an attempt towards this direction.
     My lectures (in Chinese) are avaible 
      <a href="https://www.shuishan.net.cn/education/course/1432511598644629505">at Shuishan Online</a>. 
     I am working on <a href="https://github.com/xuanzhouhub/onlineDBMSbook">an online textbook</a> (in Chinese) too.</p>
     <p><b>Course II: Data Ethics.</b> 
      I chose to teach this course just because I like reading philosophy and humanities. Data ethics happens to become increasingly important as our societies found it necessary
      to regulate the use of data.
      The slides of my lectures (in Chinese) can be found 
      <a href="https://www.shuishan.net.cn/education/course/1495593035371565057">at Shuishan Online</a>. </p>
     <p>I am partly responsible for designing and developing the <b>Curriculum of the Data Science and Engineering Major</b> at ECNU. 
     Our curriculum on Data Science and Engineering is one of the first in the world. It has had a considerable influence 
      on the development of the data science majors in China. Here is  <a href="https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_20348277">a news report</a> about it. </p>
