       <h2>Xuan Zhou</h2>
       <p>Xuan Zhou is a Professor and a Vice Dean of the School of Data Science and Engineering at East China Normal University. Prior to joining ECNU in 2017, 
       he was an associate professor at Renmin University of China, a scientist at CSIRO ICT Center (now renamed to Data61) of Australia, and a researcher at
       L3S Research Center of Germany. He obtained his Ph.D. from National University of Singapore in 2005 and his B.Sc. from Fudan University in 2001. Xuan Zhou's
       research interest lies in data management systems. He has extensive research and engineering experience on various database, data processing and data 
       interaction systems. </p>

    <h2><u>Publications</u></h2>
    <p>I have little time to maintain my publication list properly. Please refer to <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/32/3943-1.html">my DBLP page</a>.</p>
    <p>My personal view on academic publication: We humans are publishing too many than what we can manage. One probable reason is that we (intentionaly or 
     unintentionaly) have our performance evaluation metrics linked to the number of publications. I believe that there will be a revolution on this idea, sooner or later.
     In the future, research results might be more visible on some online project websites, such as GitHub, where data and programs are more accessible. Be prepared. </p>

    <h2><u>Teaching</u></h2>
    <p>I love teaching.</p>
    <p><b>Course I: Contemporary Data Management System.</b> 
     Data managements systems nowadays are not limited to RDBMS (SQL). A variety of systems are widely adopted in contemporary applications,
     including various NoSQL and data analytical systems. The landscape of data technologies are evolving fast. Traditional introductory courses
     on Database need to be reformed accordingly. This course is an attempt towards this direction.
     My lectures (in Chinese) can be found 
      <a href="https://www.shuishan.net.cn/education/course/1432511598644629505">online at Shuishan</a>. 
     I am working on <a href="https://github.com/xuanzhouhub/onlineDBMSbook">an online textbook</a> (in Chinese) too.</p>
     <p><b>Course II: Data Ethics.</b> 
      I chose to teach this course just because I like reading philosophy and humanities. Data ethics happens to become increasingly important as our societies found it necessary
      to regulate the use of data.

     <p>I am partly responsible for designing and developing the curriculum of the Data Science and Engineering Major at ECNU. 
     Our curriculum on Data Science and Engineering is one of the earliest ones world widely. It has had a considerable influence 
      on the development of the data science majors in China. Here is  <a href="https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_20348277">some news</a> about it. </p>
